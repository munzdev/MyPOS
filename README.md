# Codename MyPOS

Welcome to the Project site of Codename "MyPOS". This name will change when project is finished.

MyPOS is a Webapp which is developed to handle a Point-of-Sale System for events, clubs, NPOs. It targets 1-3 days based events (more possible)

With this system, thay can easly get orders over there Smartphone and handle them with Tables.
The idea is to keep the costs as low as possible for the organisation and optimize the order/billing system.
Billing, Order, Manage, Statics, .. all this things can be done by this app.

The waitress only needs a smartphone with a Webbrowser and the Distribution places a Tablet also with a Webbrowser.
In order to print invoices, orders, etc. its also needed to have a ESC/POS compatible Thermal printer witch can be accessed via LAN/WLAN.
Also a Server (PC or Laptop) is needed, where the App runs on and handles the smartphone/tablet requests.
